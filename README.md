# Data Science Assignment
Here’s a GitHub README template based on your completed Data Science assignment:
## Question
To explore a dataset, split it into training and testing sets, fit a linear regression model, and evaluate the model’s performance on the test set.

## Objective
To apply data exploration, data splitting, and linear regression techniques to predict target values and evaluate model accuracy.

## Task Overview
### 1. Dataset Exploration
- **Goal**: Load and analyze the Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
- **Steps**:
  - Display the first five rows.
  - Check dataset shape.
  - Generate summary statistics, including mean, standard deviation, and min/max values for each feature.

### 2. Data Splitting
- **Goal**: Split the dataset for training and testing.
- **Steps**:
  - Divide the Iris dataset into an 80-20 train-test split.
  - Verify the number of samples in each subset.

### 3. Linear Regression
- **Goal**: Predict the salary based on years of experience.
- **Steps**:
  - Load a dataset containing `YearsExperience` and `Salary`.
  - Fit a linear regression model.
  - Use Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model’s accuracy on the test data.

## Benefits
- **Data Understanding**: Gain insights into basic statistics and data structure.
- **Model Development**: Practice building and evaluating a linear regression model.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Learn how to measure model performance using MSE.

## Guidance and Important Points
- **Data Handling**: Ensure data integrity by exploring and cleaning the dataset.
- **Model Selection**: Understand why linear regression is suitable for continuous prediction tasks.
- **Error Metric**: Use Mean Squared Error to gauge prediction accuracy.

## Summary Points
1. Loaded and explored the Iris dataset with `sklearn.datasets`.
2. Split the data effectively into training and test sets (80-20).
3. Built and tested a linear regression model to predict salary from years of experience.
4. Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error, ensuring the reliability of predictions.
